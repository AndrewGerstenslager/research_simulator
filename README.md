# Place Cell Simulator

### Purpose

This is a simulator built from scratch designed to host an agent that can run different models. This simulator is designed specifically to host an agent that is running a place cell model as part of the research of Andrew Gerstenslager and Bek Dukenbaev.

### How to use

There are two programs, [main.py](main.py) and [environment_builder.py](environment_builder.py).
- main: This is the main simulator. This is where the agent can run in a world manually or through a controller.
- environment_builder: This is a tool to create environments with a gui. The worlds are saved out as .json objects for easier modification.
